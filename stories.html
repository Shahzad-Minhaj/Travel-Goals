            <h3>El Retiro Park</h3>
            <p>
              This park is the most beautiful urban park I have ever seen. My AirBnB sat right on the edge of El Retiro,
              and I made a point each day to spend time walking in and around it's lovely green spaces. In fact, I spent
              one entire afternoon meandering the grounds, taking photographs, and people watching.The park comes alive
              on the weekends: well-intentioned locals can be seen jogging on it's many paths, and young children are in
              the playgrounds or riding their scooters.

            <p>
              Our Trip started from Islamabad in Mid-October, we had to visit Naran and Saif ul Malook, we reached Naran
              after a short drive, took jeeps from there, had an easy 45 min off-road drive, and reached Saif ul Malook,
              I had been there many times but every time Saif ul Mlaook gave a new sensation, the lake is exceedingly
              clear and pure, it was statute still, beautiful and delightful. The Snow-capped Mountains and their shadow
              in crystal clear lake made its serenity. We had a night stay in Batakundi which had lovely views.

            <p>
              There are so many ways to see London! For the complete experience, I recommend you try as many different
              means of transport as you can during your London trip. Hop-on hop-off buses are extremely popular and are
              a great way to see the city and major attractions.

            <p>
              “Our Japan trip was amazing! The first day was a travel day, and we took a flight down to Dallas, where we
              then flew into Tokyo. After we landed at the airport, went through immigration, and finished up customs,
              we all met our tour guide, Taku-san, for the first time! He was probably one of my favorite parts of the
              trip as a whole. The entire group loved Taku-san because he gave us a ton of useful information, but he
              made it interesting and fun.

            <h2>Istanbul</h2>
            <p>
              It took us a long time to get to Turkey. Back at the beginning of the millennium, Istanbul and Turkey were
              high on our must-see list of destinations.
              We’d picked up a guide book and everything. But then we decided to start a new business and signed a lease
              on office space on September 10, 2001. Yup, the day before 9-11. That’s another story, but in the
              meantime, we weren’t doing a lot of travel. Slow forward. A decade later, we were on the loose again, and
              Turkey kept calling to us. It’s at the crossroads of the world and we love intersections. It’s packed with
              ancient history. It sounds exotic, but is relatively safe to travel. And a bonus: it’s a nice escape from
              the European Union when your 90 days in Schengen countries are tapped out. We arrived in Istanbul for the
              first time in November of 2011

            <p>
              One of the things I loved most about visiting Milan were the people. I found them quite friendly,
              hospitable and warm. The language barrier was not a problem at all as the people I met either tried to
              patiently listen to my bad attempt at speaking Italian and try to decipher what I was trying to
              communicate to them or they just looked around for someone who could speak better English to help.

              portals behind the massive sheet of water, then on to the Upper and Lower Observation decks at the foot of
              the Falls.

            <p>
              Spend your first day in Munich's Old Town, right in the city's centre. Munich's Old Town, also referred to
              as Altstadt, is the city's historic core and is home to numerous attractions. Old Town was first
              established as a small village on the banks of the Isar River in the Middle Ages. The community expanded
              over time, and by the 14th century, it had become the Duchy of Bavaria's capital as well as a significant
              trading hub.

              other. Sizzling beaches, high-end restaurants, dazzling nightlife, and glitzy shopping centers have
              created an aura that sets Miami apart from every other city.

            <p>
              The Blue Mountains allure walkers with epic bush-clad vistas and hidden valleys with prehistoric forests.
              You'll find the Hawkesbury River region, and to Sydney's south Royal National Park, both offer spectacular
              walking with water views. The Central Coast stretches north with uncrowded surf beaches and inlets rich
              with sea birds. And the Hunter Valley is blessed with leafy country roads dotted with producers of fine
              wine, chocolates and cheese.
